## To Run

Open in google colab or jupyter notebook. Hit run all.

Sorry about that monstrosity of an equation, I wasn't quite sure what the professor was asking for so I threw everything at the wall hoping that something would stick.

I had to do some gimmiky stuff with the biases but everything else is about as simple and understandable as I could make it.

Thanks for grading! Let me know if there's anything I can do next time to make your life easier!
